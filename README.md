# Angular-SpringBoot Projekt

This project demonstrates how to use the Spring Boot framework as the backend and the Angular framework as the frontend.

I designed and created the database model on my own, aiming to gain hands-on experience with integrating Spring Boot and Angular. Instead of following basic tutorials or examples, I wanted to challenge myself by coming up with my own ideas and implementing them from scratch. This project reflects my focus on learning through practical application and problem-solving. In the end, it's not just about the technical tools you use, but what you learn and how you apply that knowledge to create something meaningful.
